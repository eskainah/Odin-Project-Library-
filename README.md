# Odin Project Book Library 

This project is my submission of TOP library project using Object oriented programming. 

All of the book objects are going to be stored in an array, so a function is added to the 
script (not the constructor) that can take user’s input and store the new book objects 
into an array. 

Add a “NEW BOOK” button that brings up a form allowing users to input the details for the 
new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read 

A button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library.

A button on each book’s display to change its read status.
